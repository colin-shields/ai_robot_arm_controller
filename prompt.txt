I've attached 3 files: a lecture on how to control a robot arm, a demo python script showing how to use the library that controls a robot arm, and an image of blocks arranged on a 2D plane. Assume that the top left corner of the paper in the image of the blocks is at (300, 100) and the bottom right is at (155, -100) as (x, y). A safe Z-coordinate above the blocks is 0, and the Z-coordinate to pick up the blocks is -50. The functions for the vacuum pump do not need an `isQueued=1` argument. Make sure to add a dType.SetHOMECmd(api, temp=0, isQueued=1) command. Don't forget to use the vacuum pump. You are to generate Python code to perform the task outlined below. Print out only the Python code formatted in a code block:
